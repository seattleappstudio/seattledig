# Website Guide for [Your Site Name]

Welcome! This guide explains **how your website is set up** and **what you need to know** to keep it running smoothly.

This is written for **non-technical readers**, so you don’t need to know coding to follow it.

---

## 1. Overview

Your website is built using **modern web technology** that makes it:
- **Fast** to load
- **Responsive** (works on phones, tablets, and computers)
- **Easy to update** for text, images, and other content

You can think of your site as three main parts:
1. **Content** – the words, images, and videos you see on each page.
2. **Design** – the layout, colors, and fonts that make it look the way it does.
3. **Code & Files** – the “behind the scenes” part that makes it work (you don’t usually need to touch this).

## 2. Where to Find Things

Your project folder contains:

| Folder/File | Purpose | Do You Need to Edit It? |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------|
| `src/` | Holds the main website content and design files | Sometimes (for text or image updates) |
| `src/pages/` | Each page of your site is here (e.g., `Home.tsx` for the home page) | Yes, if you want to change text or layout |
| `src/assets/` | Stores images, logos, and other media | Yes, if you want to replace images |
| `package.json` | Technical settings for developers | No |
| `README.md` | This instruction file | Only if you want to update instructions |

---

## 3. Updating Your Content

You will typically change:
- **Text** – Edit the text inside the page files in `src/pages/`.
- **Images** – Replace image files in `src/assets/` with new ones (same file name to avoid extra changes).

If you prefer not to edit files directly, ask your web developer to make these updates for you.

---

## 4. How to See Your Changes

1. **Open the project folder** on your computer.
2. **Run the website locally** (developer will give you the command; usually `npm run dev`).
3. Make your text/image changes.
4. **Refresh your browser** to see the updates.

---

## 5. Publishing Updates to the Live Website

When you are happy with your changes:
1. Tell your developer to **deploy** the site (they will handle the commands).
2. The live site will update automatically.

---

## 6. Keeping Your Site Healthy

To keep your site running well:
- Review your content every 1–2 months for outdated information.
- Replace large images with smaller ones to keep pages fast.
- Let your developer know if you see errors or broken links.

---

## 7. Getting Help

If you run into problems:
- Email your web developer with a description of the issue and a screenshot if possible.
- Avoid making changes to files you don’t understand — this can break the site.
