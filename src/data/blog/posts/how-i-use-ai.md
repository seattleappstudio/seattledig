# When AI Is Useful and Where It Isn't: My View 

After two decades in tech and many conversations with clients, I’ve learned that the real question isn’t “Can AI do this?” but “Should AI do this?” That distinction guides how I use AI at Seattle Digital Studio (and just as importantly, where I don’t).

## How I Use AI in My Daily Work

For content creation, I use ChatGPT as a research assistant and first-draft generator. When drafting technical blog posts or documentation, I’ll prompt the AI for structure or plain-language explanations of complex concepts. Sometimes I ask it to brainstorm a handful of topics with hooks for writing articles about them. These early drafts speed up the process, but they’re never final. In some cases, I use two different GenAI tools (such as ChatGPT in combination with Claude) to mix it up. Every client-facing document gets significant human editing to align with brand voice, context, and audience.

On the automation side, Make.com is my go-to for building client workflows. For systems that handle lead qualification, automate content approval pipelines, and coordinate follow-ups, automation tools can save clients hours each week. These tools free up teams to focus on what matters most: high-touch interactions, strategic planning, and growth.

I also use Notion AI or Microsoft OneNote with Copilot to organize project plans and timelines. It’s particularly helpful for turning scattered notes into structured documentation, which I then refine for each unique client or project.

## What AI Does Well (and Where It Helps Clients)

AI excels at eliminating repetitive work. For one content client, I streamlined their publishing process by using AI for research and outline generation, cutting production time by more than 50%. For an nonprofit organization needing an internal dashboard, I deployed an AI-assisted full coding tool to generate a fast prototype that accelerated kick off planning conversations and ultiimately shaved more than 40% off totaal development costs. 

In each case, the role of AI is to accelerate early-stage work—not to make final decisions or replace human judgment.

## Where I Draw the Line

AI doesn’t make strategic calls. Whether it’s recommending a new feature or evaluating a platform, those decisions require experience, market awareness, and context that AI doesn’t have.

There are big risks with overreliance on AI. It is well known that generative AI toold often include hallucinations, inaccuracies, and robotic-sounding text that can hurt a company's brand. When AI is used for research on fact-based topics, every face must be checked manually. Maybe this will change as technology evolves, but at this time tools like ChatGPT must be used with caution.

For these reasons and others, I don’t hand off final content or client communications to AI. Tone, accuracy, and nuance are too important to risk. And while AI tools can suggest design layouts or user flows, I feel real user experience design depends on empathy, feedback, and creativity. 

When problems arise in projects, AI might offer suggestions, but problem-solving still requires people who understand the bigger picture and can weigh trade-offs.

## Guidance for Small Business Owners

Start with one bottleneck. Instead of trying to automate everything, find a task that’s repetitive, well-defined, and high-friction. Implement a small win and build from there.

Always keep human oversight in the loop. AI should reduce friction, not remove ownership. And before you automate, get your process in order—AI only works well when it’s working with well-designed processes!

Track your results. Know how much time or effort you’re saving and what impact the changes make. Too many businesses get excited about tools without checking whether they’re actually improving outcomes.

Finally, invest in learning. The best results come when you understand what the tools can and can’t do. A little time upfront leads to much better long-term results.

## AI Isn't Replacing You

AI will keep getting better at routine tasks, but it won’t replace the creative thinking, strategic clarity, and relationship-building that businesses thrive on. At its best, the goal is to make space for the human work that drives real growth.

Used wisely, AI gives you leverage. But it’s only as good as the person behind it.
