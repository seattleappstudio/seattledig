# Behind the Build: How Seattle Digital Studio Approaches Client Projects

When a small business or nonprofit asks Seattle Digital Studio for help with their blog, the surface issue—“the blog isn’t working”—often turns out to be just that: surface. In this post, we walk through a typical project to show how we identify the real issues, define a phased plan, choose the right tools, and deliver sustainable, high-impact results.

## Discovery: Diagnosing the Real Problem

Clients often arrive with a visible pain point like low blog engagement or repetitive client questions. During discovery, we use a simple framework to clarify what’s happening and what success would look like from their perspective. We assess content, communications, constraints, and priorities. In most cases, it’s not just a blog problem—it’s a need for consistent, strategic content that answers common questions, builds credibility, and reduces the support load on the internal team.

## Phased Planning: Strategy Before Tech

We recommend a phased approach. We focus on starting small, showing results early, and building trust.

In Phase 1, we focus on content strategy: setting up an editorial calendar and review workflow, delivering several blog posts in the first month, and developing content that supports thought leadership. All content is optimized for SEO and brand voice. Typical startup costs range from $2,000 to $3,500 based on volume and complexity, and a monthly retainer of $500 to $1,000 based on the number of blog posts to be created each month.

A typical Phase 2 might focus on building a lightweight client portal using a no-code platform. We create a secure dashboard where clients can access documents, check project status, and reduce their reliance on email. This one-time investment typically costs $1,000 to $3,500, with ongoing support starting at least at $150/month. The phased rollout minimizes risk and makes implementation manageable for lean teams.

## Choosing the Right Tools

We tailor tools to the client’s needs—not the other way around. For blog workflows, we often use Notion to manage content planning, Google Docs for collaboration, and WordPress for publishing. To track performance, we incorporate Google Analytics and Search Console.

For client portals, Bubble is our preferred no-code platform. It supports user authentication, document sharing, and admin updates without requiring a developer. For clients with internal dev capacity, we may recommend a custom React + TypeScript build—especially for long-term customization or AI integration.

## Build Process: Step-by-Step Delivery

On the content side, we start by auditing existing material, defining brand voice, developing templates, and delivering optimized posts on a clear schedule. For portals, we map out wireframes, build the dashboard, test across devices, and provide full documentation so clients can manage their systems independently.

Each phase undergoes quality assurance to ensure everything functions properly, looks polished, and meets business goals.

## Handoff: Empowering Clients to Own It

A clear handoff sets clients up for success. We provide training, detailed documentation, and baseline metrics so clients know where things stand and how to move forward. The wrap-up package includes guidance on maintaining momentum, updating content, and evolving systems as the business grows.

## Optional Ongoing Support

Many clients opt for continued support. Our $500 to $1,000/month content retainer includes several blog posts, calendar management, SEO, and monthly reporting. Portal maintenance and support start at $200/month and include security updates, technical checks, and troubleshooting. Clients who don't want to pay for a retainer can purchase one-off development work for us at our hourly rate.

Ongoing support ensures continued ROI and frees internal teams to focus on strategic priorities.
