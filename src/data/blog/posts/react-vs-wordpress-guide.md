# What Stack?: How We Choose Between React and WordPress

Choosing the right tech stack is one of the most important decisions in any web development project. The right choice supports long-term growth, while the wrong one can lead to performance issues, high maintenance costs, and platform limitations that are expensive to undo.

At Seattle Digital Studio, we’ve built everything from marketing sites to complex applications. We don’t believe in defaulting to one stack. Instead, we use a decision framework that balances technical requirements, business goals, budget, and team capabilities.

## What Goes Wrong with Stack Decisions

Choosing the wrong platform creates ripple effects: sluggish performance, SEO issues, limited integrations, rising technical debt, and frustrated teams. Poor alignment between the platform and project goals often leads to rebuilds that could have been avoided with clearer upfront planning.

Some platforms are easier to launch on, but harder to scale. Others offer full flexibility but require more time, money, and technical resources. Platform lock-in, plugin bloat, or poor integration options can all become costly obstacles if not considered early.

## Our Three-Phase Evaluation Framework

Before choosing a stack, we start with business requirements. A static site, a blog, and an interactive app all have different needs. We assess scope, content workflows, integration complexity, and performance expectations. Then we look at your internal resources. Do you have in-house devs? Will you be updating content yourself? Are you planning rapid iterations?

Once we understand the business and team, we map requirements to platform strengths. For example, React supports advanced functionality and custom workflows, while WordPress offers robust content tools and fast deployment.

## When We Recommend React

React is a great choice for modern, interactive apps. Its component-based structure, high performance, and extensive ecosystem make it ideal for dashboards, single-page apps (SPAs), and custom workflows. React shines when you need real-time updates, dynamic interfaces, or seamless integrations with APIs.

React requires a more technical team, a longer build timeline, and more careful planning. But if your project demands a fully custom front-end experience, React gives you the flexibility to build exactly what you need. Using React with AI-powered, prompt-based programming tools can improve the speed of development and lower costs dramatically.

## When We Recommend WordPress

WordPress powers over 40% of the web for a reason. It’s user-friendly, fast to deploy, and rich in plugins. For content-heavy sites like blogs, it delivers excellent SEO out of the box. It’s also a cost-effective option for businesses without a development team.

Using themes and plugins strategically, we can launch professional sites quickly while still supporting complex needs like e-commerce, memberships, or multilingual content. However, WordPress does require ongoing updates, occasional plugin conflicts, and more attention to performance tuning.

## Key Tradeoffs

React offers more control and power, but comes with a higher cost and technical overhead. WordPress is easier to manage and maintain for non-technical users, but has limitations around customization and scalability.

If your content rarely changes, and your app needs to be lightning-fast with custom logic, React may be the better fit. If you’re publishing regularly, care about SEO, and need something launched fast, WordPress might be the way to go.

## How We Guide Clients

We start with a discovery process to align on goals, audience, content flow, and tech constraints. Then we recommend a platform based on real needs, not hype or preference. If the best solution is React, we’ll scope it appropriately. If it’s WordPress, we’ll build it with performance, security, and scalability in mind.

Every platform has strengths. The key is knowing which one fits your business now and in the future. Our job is to help you make that call with confidence.
